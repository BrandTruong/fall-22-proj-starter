# CS 131 Fall 2022: Project Starter

Hey there! This is a template repository that contains the necessary boilerplate for [CS 131](https://ucla-cs-131.github.io/fall-22/)'s quarter-long project: making an interpreter. You can read the [spec for the project on Google Docs](#TODO).

There are three stages to the project; students are currently at the first. Thus, this folder contains the necessary bootstrapping code:

- `intbase.py`, the base class and enum definitions for the interpreter
- a sample `readme.txt`, which should illustrate any known bugs/issues with the program (or, an "everything's good!")

Note: **we will update this repository with canonical solutions once the project deadline is over**.

Some notes on your submission:

1. You **must have a top-level, versioned `interpreter.py` file** that **exports the `Interpreter` class**. If not, **your code will not run on our autograder**.
  - for Project 1, your file should be named `interpreterv1.py`
  - for Project 2, your file should be named `interpreterv2.py`
  - for Project 3, your file should be named `interpreterv3.py`
2. Otherwise, you can split your code into however many `.py` files as you wish; however, **they must have the `.py` extension!**

You can find out more about our autograder, including how to run it, in [its accompanying repo](#TODO).
